       "content": "The US job market continues to chug along despite heightened uncertainty about the economy and how President Donald Trump’s tariffs could shake out. The economy added a stronger-than-expected 147,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. Last month’s gains, which landed above expectations for 117,500 jobs to be added, marked a slight increase from May’s total, which was revised up slightly (5,000 jobs) to 144,000. April’s job gains were revised higher by 11,000 jobs, for a net gain of 158,000. Those revisions and Thursday’s data bring the three-month average job growth to 150,000. However, despite the continuation of fairly solid monthly employment gains, Thursday’s jobs report once again showed several potentially concerning signs, including some fissures that may be spreading under the weight of the Trump administration’s economy-shifting policies. Less encouraging details emerge Notably, job growth is not widespread, indicating that the biggest opportunities are within a select few industries. The vast majority of the month’s gains were in health care (+58,600 jobs), leisure and hospitality (+20,000 jobs), and state and local government (+80,000 jobs*). [*The sharp increase here is likely “artificial,” economists for Pantheon Economics cautioned. More on that below.] And when stripping out the public sector gains (the +80,000 was offset slightly by a loss of 7,000 jobs federally), US private sector businesses added 74,000 jobs in June, the smallest monthly gain since October 2024. “The tariff tax hike, restrictive monetary policy and worries about a further intensification of the trade war are weighing heavily on labor demand,” Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in an investor note on Thursday. “Private payrolls excluding healthcare and education rose by just 23,000, well below the 50,000 average pace in the previous 12 months. Fundamentally, then, this is a weak report.” Tombs noted that the mathematical adjustments made by the BLS to smooth out seasonal fluctuations (think: construction employment surging in the spring and retail ramping up hiring in advance of Christmas) may have made the overall numbers look a little more rosy. Education jobs typically fall in the summertime; however, the decrease was not as sharp this year, which the seasonal adjustment factor relayed as a strong gain. The labor force participation rate ticked down, while the unemployment rate for Black workers surged by 0.8 percentage points to 6.8%, its highest rate since January 2022. The household survey, one of two that feed into the monthly jobs report, often can have volatile monthly swings; however, rising unemployment levels for Black workers has in the past served as an indicator of impending economic weakness. “There has been this thought that when the economy slows, Black workers might feel the effects of that more quickly, because they might be in situations that have less job security,” Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor, told CNN in an interview. “But the timescale for that tends to be pretty short, and it is very dependent on which industries are impacted.” Workers’ wages overall increased at a slower pace than economists expected. Average hourly earnings rose by 8 cents, or 0.2%, to $36.30 last month, bringing the annual rate to 3.7% from 3.9%. The headline unemployment rate moving down to 4.1% also may be a function of a declining labor force, economists cautioned. “One gets the sense that the cumulative impact of tighter immigration policy is on the margin beginning to impact the size of the labor force and will impose a ceiling on any prospective increase in the unemployment rate as the economy slows,” Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM US, wrote in a note on Thursday. Layoff activity remains muted Stocks were higher Thursday: The Dow rose by 365 points, or 0.8% by mid-morning. The broader S&P 500 rose 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.9%. Trump has introduced a bevy of sweeping policies that have the potential to impact the economy. However, questions around how those actions will shake out — particularly the size and scope of tariffs — have heightened uncertainty and hampered hiring activity, to some extent. For several months running, the labor market has been in a state of low churn: Hiring activity is at near 10-year lows and workers aren’t feeling confident enough to quit; however, employers, for the most part, are holding on to the workers they have. Layoff activity hasn’t accelerated recently, according to a variety of indicators, including weekly jobless claims data. On Thursday, the latest batch of claims data showed that first-time filings for unemployment insurance — considered a proxy for layoffs — decreased to 233,000 for the week ended June 28 from 237,000 the week before, according to a separate report released by the Department of Labor. While first-time claims aren’t steadily on the rise, people appear to be having a harder time finding work when they’re unemployed. Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received jobless benefits for at least one week, have been butting up against three-and-a-half-year highs. During the week that ended June 21 (continuing claims data runs at a lag), those filings were unchanged at 1.964 million, according to the Labor Department report. Thursday’s jobs report highlighted a similar trend: Job seekers are staying unemployed for roughly six months, and the share of unemployed workers who have been out of a job for 27 weeks or longer rose to 23.3%, edging closer to a three-year high, BLS data shows. The Fed could remain on the sidelines In periods of high uncertainty, economic data becomes all the more important to get a grasp on any indications that a downturn could be in the works. That’s especially true for the data-dependent Federal Reserve, which anticipated easing its decades-high interest rates this year but has held off out of concern that Trump’s tariffs could stoke inflation and put a squeeze on businesses and consumers. “There’s nothing in this report that forces the Fed’s hands to cut rates earlier than expected,” Zhao said. “It does look healthy from a top-line view.” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on June 25 in Washington, DC. Related article Powell says the Fed would have cut rates this year if it weren’t for tariffs However, there is some concern about how to interpret the number in an environment where the labor force growth is significantly slowing and the extent to which lower immigration flows could be contributing to that, he said. What do you think? Join 273 others in the comments View Comments Ultimately, one of the biggest questions could be around the breakeven employment growth level (amount of jobs needed to keep pace with labor force and population growth). Estimates for the breakeven level, which pre-pandemic was running about 70,000 to 100,000 jobs per month, sometimes soared north of 200,000 jobs in recent years because of heightened levels of immigration. At this point, considering demographics, an aging workforce and a slowdown in immigration that started in the mid-point of last year, the breakeven level is likely closer to 100,000 jobs per month, Deutsche Bank economists noted in a research report last week. That could drop even lower, to around 50,000 jobs per month, depending on whether the Trump administration’s immigration policies result in an outright decrease in the foreign-born population, they noted. “If the break-even level of jobs growth is falling, then 147,000 jobs added might actually be inflationary,” Zhao said. “And if the unemployment rate stays low or keeps falling and inflation stays high — especially as tariffs make their way through the supply chain — the Fed might be pushed to keep rates higher for longer.”"

        "title": "Trump says he is about to raise tariffs as high as 70% on some countries",
        "source": "CNN",
        "content": "On April 9, President Donald Trump gave the world a three-month window to negotiate trade deals with the United States or face higher “reciprocal” tariffs. With just five days remaining in that tariff moratorium, the White House is expected to begin delivering a message to a dozen or so countries: Time is up, and here’s your new tariff rate. Trump early Friday at Joint Base Andrews told reporters that he would notify 10 to 12 nations a day over the course of the next five days, detailing their new tariffs in letters that the White House would begin sending on Friday. In most cases, the new rates would go into effect August 1, Trump said. “They’ll range in value from maybe 60% or 70% tariffs to 10% and 20% tariffs, but they’re going to be starting to go out sometime tomorrow,” Trump said. “We’ve done the final form, and it’s basically going to explain what the countries are going to be paying in tariffs.” In April, Trump imposed “reciprocal” tariffs as high as 50% on most of America’s trading partners. So tariffs of 60% or 70% would exceed those rates, which sent stocks crumbling into bear-market territory, while bonds and the US dollar sold off sharply. US stocks and bonds markets were closed Friday for Independence Day, but stock markets and futures fell around the world. still_21512434_152693.267_still.jpg Hear Trump break down tariffs on various countries 02:59 It’s not clear yet which countries would receive the letters, but Trump has called out certain trading partners for driving too hard of a bargain, including the European Union and Japan. Trump this week threatened to send a letter to “spoiled” Japan setting its tariff rate as high as 35%. Still, that may have been a negotiating tactic, and it’s not known whether those partners will be among the countries for whom the White House will set new tariffs. Trump said he expected the letters to be delivered by the administration’s self-imposed July 9 deadline to draft deals. The administration has said at times that its timeframe was flexible for countries that make a good-faith effort to negotiate with the United States. On Friday, a European Union diplomat told CNN that the trading bloc was in the “middle of very difficult negotiations,” which would likely continue into the weekend as the deadline approaches. The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they are not permitted to speak on the record about closed-door meetings, told CNN the talks are proceeding in a constructive manner, but it is unclear whether the administration’s July 9 deadline will be extended if a finalized agreement isn’t reached in time. Olof Gill, a trade spokesperson from the European Commission, said in a briefing Friday that he couldn’t share specifics about trade talks since they were in “a very sensitive phase of negotiations.” For countries that are continuing to negotiate with the United States but have not yet reached a deal, including India, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that “the deadline is not critical.” That’s a point that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized to Fox Business last week, too, saying he thinks trade negotiations could be “wrapped up” by Labor Day, providing a more relaxed framework for inking deals than the previously prescribed July 9 deadline. But Trump appeared to adjust that timeframe on Friday. Asked if countries would be afforded any flexibility with the tariff deadline, Trump said, “not really.” “They’ll start to pay on August 1. The money will start to come into the United States on August 1, in pretty much all cases,” Trump said. Still, Bessent on Thursday told Bloomberg TV that he predicted a “flurry” of deals before July 9. And for those who couldn’t reach an agreement with the United States, “about 100 countries” could continue to face only the 10% minimum tariff rates that the United States imposed during Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2. Trump appeared to confirm that this week, saying, “We have a couple of other deals,” and, “As we get to the smaller countries, we’re pretty much going to keep the tariffs the same.” ‘How many deals could you make?’ So far, the administration has signed narrow frameworks for trade deal negotiations with just two partners: the United Kingdom and China. Trump this week said his administration has also reached an agreement with Vietnam, though the status of that arrangement remains unknown, and a framework does not appear to have been signed. The White House has not provided terms of the Vietnam agreement beyond a social media post from Trump. For months, the Trump administration has said deals are imminent, working with 18 key partners to lower trade barriers while hundreds of other countries wait in line to get out from under the burden of higher tariffs. At one point, Trump said 200 deals were possible and nearly done. “I’ve made all the deals,” Trump said in a Time interview in late April, saying trade negotiations with foreign partners were nearly complete. “I’ve made 200 deals.” More than two weeks later, Trump acknowledged that hundreds or even dozens of deals aren’t possible on such a short timeframe — a point he reiterated last Friday at a press briefing at the White House. “You know, we have 200 countries,” Trump said. “We can’t do that. So at a certain point, over the next week and a half or so, or maybe before, we’re going to send out a letter. We talked to many of the countries, and we’re just going to tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States. And it’s going to go very quickly.” That idea of establishing new tariffs for countries that can’t or won’t reach a deal with the United States has been floating around for over two months, but the timeline keeps getting pushed back. On April 23, Trump said his administration would “set the tariff” for countries that fail to negotiate new terms in the following few weeks. On May 16, Trump said that “at a certain point, over the next two to three weeks … we’ll be telling people what they’ll be paying to do business in the United States.” On Thursday, Trump said those letters are a day away. “It’s just much easier,” Trump said. “We have far more than 170 countries, and how many deals could you make?” CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald, Samantha Delouya and James Frater contributed to this report.

        "source": "CNN",
        "content": "Canada will rescind a digital services tax – a way of taxing online companies – its government said on Sunday, in a bid to restart trade negotiations with the United States. US President Donald Trump on Friday canceled trade talks between the two countries, blaming the tax that he called “a direct and blatant attack on our Country.” In a statement Sunday night, the Canadian government said it was stepping back from the tax to help bring the countries back to the table. “To support those negotiations, the Minister of Finance and National Revenue, the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, announced today that Canada would rescind the Digital Services Tax (DST) in anticipation of a mutually beneficial comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States,” according to the statement. “Consistent with this action, Prime Minister Carney and President Trump have agreed that parties will resume negotiations with a view towards agreeing on a deal by July 21, 2025.” CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Digital services taxes are a way for countries to tax online services, in contrast to taxes on physical products. Trump has lumped DSTs into what he calls “non-tariff trade barriers,” ways for other countries to restrict competition within their borders – often, Trump says, at the expense of US companies. The Canadian DST was set to take effect on Monday, retroactive to 2022. Canada’s plan to cancel the tax is a major win for Trump, who often says that other countries are “ripping off” the United States. Canada and the US are major trading partners, but Trump upended that relationship soon after returning to office in January, threatening a tariff of at least 25% on all Canadian exports. What do you think? Join 62 others in the comments View Comments Since then, Trump has made a number of changes to his trade policy and to tariff rates, not just for Canadian goods but for imports from across the world. The whipsaw changes have stoked uncertainty in the US and abroad, prompting companies large and small to reconsider their plans for the rest of the year. Nor are Trump’s tariff changes over: On July 9, a deadline for dozens of countries to avoid “reciprocal” tariffs unless they negotiate deals expires. While Trump could extend that deadline if he chose, it’s unclear yet if he will do so. Canada is the top buyer of American goods, importing $349 billion worth last year, according to Department of Commerce data. Meanwhile, Canada shipped $413 billion worth of goods to the US last year, the third-highest source of foreign goods. This is a developing story and will be updated."

        "headline": "Why Black unemployment just rose to its highest level since January 2022",
        "source": "CNN",
        "content": "Unemployment among Black Americans last month reached its highest level in more than three years, in stark contrast to the broader labor market’s resilience. The jobless rate for Black Americans climbed to 6.8% in June, the Labor Department said Thursday, up sharply from May’s 6% and the highest level since January 2022. Meanwhile, the national unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% and employers added a stronger-than-expected 147,000 jobs in June, according to Thursday’s jobs report. Joblessness also declined for Whites, Hispanics and Asians. President Donald Trump’s chaotic trade war, which paralyzed business decision-making and sparked fears of higher prices, was one factor in the rise in Black unemployment. For months, businesses have said the Trump administration’s significant policy changes — from on-again, off-again tariffs to cuts in federal funding — have made it difficult to plan ahead, prompting some to put hiring plans on hold, according to various surveys. Black Americans are usually impacted first whenever the economy begins to weaken, economists say. Black Americans lag behind their White counterparts in income, wealth, financial savings and home ownership, according to previous CNN reporting. Additionally, the Trump administration has placed diversity, equity and inclusion programs in its crosshairs. “When the economy slows down, Black workers may be impacted more quickly or more severely,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. “But it’s consistent with the broader story for all workers of unemployment trending upwards over the last two years. We’ve just seen more of that for Black workers.” And while the broader labor market seems to be chugging along, that has mostly been due to a few industries: health care, local government and hospitality. In June, the private education and health services industry was up a remarkable 411,000 net jobs compared to six months ago, according to Labor Department data. All other industries, except government and hospitality, added fewer than 51,000 jobs each during that same period. “Black Americans tend to work in transportation, warehousing and utilities, which are industries where we’ve seen hiring pulled back, especially in the last few months,” said Cory Stahle, senior economist at employment site Indeed. “Businesses are trying to figure out what they’re going to commit to as far as pricing, spending and hiring while trying to navigate these tariffs and the uncertainty.” What do you think? Join 71 others in the comments View Comments Black Americans may also be feeling the brunt of the Trump’s administration’s aggressive downsizing of the federal government, which shed 7,000 jobs last month. Federal employment is down 69,000 from January, according to the Labor Department. “Job losses in the federal government have continued, which could be explaining part of what’s going on, especially as the administration targets Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs,” said Jessica Fulton, senior fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that studies the challenges facing Black Americans. “Black Americans are more likely to work in federal government in particular.” Zhao, Stahle and Fulton all said it’s too soon to make any decisive conclusions about the economic state of Black Americans based the latest employment figures. The household survey the Labor Department uses to calculate monthly employment figures draws from relatively small sample sizes for different racial and ethnic groups, making the numbers more prone to swings from month to month. Despite the labor market’s resilience, the economy has shown some signs of weakness in other areas. In addition to the limited job growth in most industries, consumer spending fell after tariff-induced spending sprees in the spring."
