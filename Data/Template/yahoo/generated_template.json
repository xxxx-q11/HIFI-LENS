US President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order after delivering remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden entitled One early plan had focused on levying differing duties for each country, while another focused on a flat universal rate that Trump had pushed on the 2024 campaign trail. Wednesday’s highly anticipated unveiling comes at a delicate moment for the economy and markets, with stocks facing volatility for weeks on ever-changing tariff news and also few indications that this week’s announcement will quickly end the investor uncertainty. Worldwide retaliation against Trump’s plan has already been promised, with nations like China, Japan, and South Korea even making plans to team up and jointly respond to Trump’s move. Capitol Economics said in a note Wednesday that uncertainty may remain in the stock market even after today ”judging by the president’s mercurial approach to imposing tariffs.” The approach unveiled Wednesday was an attempt by the president and his team to handle not just tariffs but also so-called non-tariff barriers that have long galled him. Trump’s team factored in a wide array of practices into its calculations, from currency manipulation to things like value-added taxes to export subsidies to technical barriers to agricultural constraints. \"Tariffs are customized to each country,\" a senior administration official told reporters, saying it was \"based on the concept that the trade deficit that we have with any given country is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\" \"In many cases, the non-monetary barriers were worse than the monetary ones,\" the president added Wednesday.

It's a tactic that allows him to move quickly but could also be vulnerable to legal challenges in the months ahead, with relevant portions of the law not having faced legal tests in decades. Other duties have been on a different track, including this week’s 25% duties on automobiles that are being levied through a different and more legally tested authority derived from Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 focused on national security.

        "headline": "Trump tariffs live updates: Trump set to impose tariffs of up to 70% in letter push as July 9 deadline looms",
        "source": "yahoo",
        "content": "Time has run out for some US trade partners looking to make deals ahead of President Trump's July 9 deadline for tariffs to snap back to higher levels. Letters will start going out to countries on Friday to notify them of the tariff rates they will face on exports to the US, Trump told reporters, to go into effect on Aug. 1. The first 10 or 12 letters sent out will be followed by similar batches. “By the ninth they’ll be fully covered,” Trump said in reference to the deadline, per Bloomberg. “They’ll range in value from maybe 60% or 70% tariffs to 10% and 20% tariffs.” The Trump team has so far been focused on hammering out trade deals, though it has succeeded in nailing only three pacts so far. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said around 100 partners would likely see a minimum 'reciprocal' rate of 10% come next week, adding that he expects a 'flurry' of deals to materialize before the deadline. Here is where things stand with various partners: China: The US has eased export restrictions on China for chip design software and ethane, a sign that trade tensions are calming between the two countries after they agreed in May to a framework to move toward a larger trade deal. Software firms like Synopsys (SNPS) and Cadence (CDNS) said they will now sell their chip design tools to Chinese customers again. The US also removed limits on ethane exports to China that it had set just weeks ago. Vietnam: Trump on Wednesday said he had reached a trade deal with Vietnam, one that will see the country's imports face a 20% tariff — lower than the 46% he had threatened in April. He also said Vietnamese goods would face a higher 40% tariff 'on any transshipping' — when goods shipped from Vietnam originate from another country, like China. Many US goods will see no duty upon import to Vietnam. Japan: Trump earlier this week said negotiations with Japan had soured, saying he would force Japan to accept higher tariffs of '30%, 35%, or whatever the number is that we determine.' Notably, that proposal is higher than the 24% 'Liberation Day' level. 'They’re very tough. You have to understand, they’re very spoiled,' he said. European Union: The EU has signaled it is willing to accept a 10% universal tariff on many of its exports but is seeking exemptions for pharmaceuticals, alcohol, semiconductors, and commercial aircraft as part of a trade deal. Bessent said US-EU talks would continue through the weekend. Trump has threatened 50% tariffs on the bloc's imports. Canada: Canada has scrapped its digital services tax that was set to affect large US technology companies. The White House said trade talks between the two countries had resumed after Trump threatened to cut off trade talks. They are aiming for a deal by mid-July."

        "headline": "Thinking of buying an EV? Your tax credit window is closing",
        "source": "yahoo",
        "content": "On Thursday, Congress approved legislation, which Trump has called the “big, beautiful bill.” The bill will give tax breaks to corporations and cut spending on Medicaid by $1.2 trillion. After Trump signs it into law on the 4th of July, it also will end tax credits on buying or leasing EVs, effective Sept. 30. Since 2008, purchasing an electric vehicle has come with an incentive: a $7,500 federal tax credit for new vehicles. The incentive was expanded in 2022 to include up to $4,000 on used EVs. While EVs cost an average of $9,000 more than a gas-powered vehicle, not paying for gas means you’ll eventually make up the cost. Plus, the environmental impacts are well-known. However, despite the benefits of EVs, the incentive, which helped boost American sales, will soon be a thing of the past. While the bill does away with the tax incentive, it also eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy shortfalls, making it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles. On Thursday, the Electrification Coalition, an EV advocacy group, said the bill will have negative impacts on the American EV market, giving other markets like China a competitive advantage. In a July 3 statement, it warned, that “as EVs secure a growing share of the global automotive market, it is obvious that the future of transportation is electric; this bill forfeits America’s role in that future to China.” And as other markets lean into the EV market, the U.S. is already lagging behind. Electrification Coalition Vice President of Policy Anne Blair echoed the same sentiment, saying, “Without a competitive U.S. EV industry, we will remain dependent on volatile oil markets to power our vehicles and reliant on China for the critical minerals used in most advanced technologies. We are incredibly disappointed that Congress has made a choice to entrench these vulnerabilities.” Experts are predicting escalated sales leading up to the Sept. 30 deadline. Dan Levy, Barclays’ auto analyst, wrote in a research note, that without the incentive sales will take a steep downturn. “We believe the bill reiterates the slowdown ahead for EV penetration in the US, with both the ‘carrot’ (i.e. tax credits/incentives) and the ‘stick’ (i.e. emissions regulations) softened,” Levy said, per Reuters. One study from Harvard University projected that ending the incentive will save the U.S. government $129 billion in the next 10 years. However, it will reduce EV market penetration by 6% over the next five years. That downturn could have big environmental impacts like dirtier air and greater greenhouse gas emissions."

        "source": "yahoo",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are hitting fresh record highs on renewed trade deal hopes. Also giving stocks a boost is the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, which rose 16% in June. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal reports on the latest market action. 00:00 Brad About two hours into the start of trading, let's go live to the Nasdaq to get a read on the biggest factors moving markets today. Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's Ali Canal. 00:12 Ali Canal Hi Brad, well, I'm on record watch here, particularly for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite because we are currently trading above those all-time highs. And as a refresher here, the S&P 500 needs to close above 6,144 to notch a new record. That was the peak back in December, and then the Nasdaq's aiming for 20,174, which would be ahead of its all-time high that we saw in mid-December. So again, we are easily on track to hit those highs. Of course, these gains will have to hold here, but really just a stunning and historic bounce back for stocks since those April lows. And here's what's helping boost markets today. The main catalyst: positive trade developments. We now have a deal with China on the table and now Bloomberg also reporting that the European Union and the US are optimistic that they could reach their own trade deal before that July 9th deadline. That's when Washington plans to slap 50% tariffs on almost all EU products, and the EU has said that they are ready to respond with their own countermeasures. Bloomberg referring to a closed-door summit that happened on Thursday with EU leaders who said there's a confidence there that a deal could be struck to avoid that costly trade war. Meanwhile, we did see some fresh economic data earlier this morning. We had PCE painting a more stagflationary picture, but consumer sentiment saw a boost in June. The index coming in at 60.7 for June. That's up from 52.2 in May and slightly beating expectations. The survey did cover a pretty turbulent time. We saw various protests across the US when it comes to immigration policies, but economists now saying that the initial shock from Trump's tariff announcements, that has diminished. Still, we have confidence that remains about 20% lower than December 2024 levels as consumers continue to navigate a lot of these uncertainties. And to that point, the Fed has said that we should see some tariff-related price hikes later this summer. So confidence, you know, can be choppy perhaps over this summer. Uh, we could see some choppiness, more volatility in markets as well as earnings season is about to ramp up. Maybe if we don't see, uh, what we saw in the first quarter, that could lead to some hesitancy in this market. But for now, stocks really looking past a lot of this noise and trading at those record highs, Brad. 04:02 Brad All right, Ali, we're going to continue to track this throughout the rest of today's trading session. Thank you."
