In the latest escalation in the feud between Trump and Powell, the president appeared to call for Powell to resign after the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) alleged Powell gave \"deceptive\" testimony to Congress. Trump has expressed frustration with Powell for months for refusing to lower the Fed’s interest rates, which he has said was costing the U.S. a \"fortune.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent weighs in on the 'big, beautiful bill' as it's expected to pass in the House, job creation in the U.S., President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs and more on 'Mornings with Maria.'video Trump's leadership united GOP amid 'big, beautiful bill' vote, Treasury Secretary Bessent says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent weighs in on the 'big, beautiful bill' as it's expected to pass in the House, job creation in the U.S., President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs and more on 'Mornings with Maria.' On Monday, Trump sent a note to Powell highlighting how other countries around the world have lower interest rates compared to the U.S., continuing to accuse Powell of keeping rates \"artificially high.\" Then, Trump took to his Truth Social account Wednesday to make it clear Powell \"should resign immediately.\" Bessent's name has reportedly been floated as a potential Fed chair pick, according to the Wall Street Journal, but he carefully tiptoed around his answers on whether he's considering the switch. \"We have a lot of great candidates for the Federal Reserve. I think I have the best job in Washington. I get to interact with the president. The Cabinet that he's chosen is fantastic, and being part of that Cabinet is the dream of a lifetime for me. But I will go where the president thinks that I am best suited,\" Bessent said."

The deal would likely need to be approved by China, Trump said, adding he believes the agreement would benefit both countries.

APPLE AND GOOGLE RESTORE ABILITY TO DOWNLOAD TIKTOK APP The U.S. came close earlier this year to making a deal with Chinese-owned TikTok to spin off its U.S. operations into a new company owned by U.S. investors, but the Chinese government said it wouldn’t agree to it, citing the Trump administration’s tariffs, according to a report.

Trump signed an executive order at the time extending the deadline for TikTok for another 90 days. A second extension was issued in April and a third was signed in June. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, passed by Congress in April 2024 with wide bipartisan support, gave TikTok nine months to either separate from ByteDance or be removed from U.S.-based app stores and hosting services. In passing the law, Congress cited concerns over the app's Chinese ownership, which members said meant the app had the potential to be weaponized or used to amass vast amounts of user data.

    "title": "Americans trapped in side hustle economy as 9-to-5 jobs no longer pay the bills",
    "source": "Foxnews",
    "content": "The typical nine-to-five job isn’t cutting it for many Americans as the cost of living continues to rise. Even those with full-time careers in fields, such as real estate and tech, are turning to side hustles to cover bills and make ends meet. \"We’re seeing a surge in people turning to side hustles as a way to build financial stability in these uncertain economic times,\" Kira Caban, flexible work expert and head of communications for Instawork, told FOX Business. At Instawork, which connects businesses with temporary and full-time workers, Caban said the younger generation is driving this trend. ONLINE SIDE HUSTLES THAT WILL SCORE YOU SOME EXTRA CASH PRETTY EASILY, QUICKLY Two years ago, about 20% of new signups were between the ages of 18 and 24. That jumped to 40% in recent weeks, according to Caban. \"For many, flexible work is helping them cover the rising costs of daily essentials and giving them the financial breathing room to still enjoy things like a summer vacation without tapping into savings they may want to preserve in case the economic uncertainty continues,\" Caban added. A March LendingTree survey showed that 40% of Americans have a side hustle as the cost of living increases. Most of them, about 61% of those who have one, say their life would be unaffordable without it. \"The sad truth is that life is crazy-expensive in 2025, and for many people, their 9-to-5 job just isn’t enough for them to live comfortably,\" LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schultz told FOX Business. Homemade quilts Jenny Turley of Chattanooga, Tennessee, sells her quilts as a side hustle. (Turley Family) Approximately a third of side hustlers say they have one due to cost-of-living expenses, while 29% say they need the money for bills and 28% say it’s used for discretionary income. When asked what the driver was for starting their side hustle, almost half of them said the current economy. \"Even if people are able to pay their bills and stay current on their debt payments, there’s often not much to put towards things like emergency funds, retirement savings and other financial goals, much less toward fun things like concert tickets or a summer vacation,\" he added. The added benefit of a side hustle, according to Schultz, is that it can help people build emergency savings, pay down debt and work toward long-term financial goals. It can also provide a safety net in case the primary source of income goes away, he added. Jenny Turley, a real estate agent in Chatanooga, Tennessee, found herself working three jobs at one point in her life. Quilting was something that helped combat her stress when things got chaotic at work. Woman with her dog Dani Maczynski works full-time in tech but also has a pet care business. (Maczynski Family) In 2021, after Turley's husband had a stroke, she leveraged her skills to bring in extra cash. \"Overnight we went from everything being perfect to now the weight of the world was on my shoulders. After he came home from the hospital , I spent every day, all day, stressing and worrying how I was going to keep us going,\" she said, adding that she was worried about how they were going to make it through this event, including financially. 10 HOBBIES THAT COULD SAVE (AND MAKE) YOU MONEY IN 2024 \"I started spending every night after work in my sewing room trying to keep my mind straight and not worry. Quilting truly at that time was the one thing that kept me sane and kept my mind from going to the worst possible places. That year I just made quilts with no one to give them to, but I started having more than I could hold on to,\" Turley said. She donated a few to other stroke patients at Siskin Hospital in 2021, and by the following year, she was selling them. Her business is spread through word of mouth on Nextdoor, which is a hyperlocal social networking service for neighborhoods. Dani Maczynski, a New Jersey-based tech worker, felt compelled to tack on another gig to pay for life expenses and save for her future. Working from home Many full-time professionals are looking toward side hustles to help make ends meet. (iStock / iStock) When she's not working, Maczynski is walking dogs for a handful of clients every week or pet sitting, when she will have a dog come to her house, or she will go to the owner's home. She also offers overnight boarding services a few times each month. \"Shifting my mindset to see every dollar as a tool for long-term growth has been really empowering,\" Maczynski said. \"What started as a short-term side hustle has become part of a bigger financial strategy and that’s something I plan to keep building on.\" Still, Schultz noted that side hustles are not a miracle cure and, often, they require a real financial investment and there's no guarantee they will be successful. \"None of this means that people should shy away from side hustles. It just means that people should take them with their eyes wide open, understanding what’s involved,\" he said."

    "source": "Foxnews",
    "content": "Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic warned Thursday that he believes tariffs are likely to cause a prolonged stretch of inflation as opposed to a one-time spike in costs. Rather than \"a short and simple one-time shift in prices, as standard textbook models would suggest,\" Bostic said he expects changes in U.S. trade policy along with concurrent geopolitical developments to lead to \"a longer period of elevated inflation\" over the course of a year or more. Amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump on the Fed to loosen its monetary policy position, Bostic firmly backed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments from Tuesday that the central bank should wait to adjust its policy stance as it continues to track how tariffs might impact prices.

(Photographer: Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) FED CHAIR POWELL CONFIRMS TARIFF CONCERNS PREVENTED INTEREST RATE CUTS SO FAR THIS YEAR Bostic, who is not a voting member of the central bank’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), said the current period marked by economic uncertainty is \"no time for significant shifts in monetary policy.\" The next FOMC meeting is July 29-30. Trump’s 90-day pause on the sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" he announced on April 2 is set to expire on July 9. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told FOX Business’ \"Mornings with Maria\" on Thursday that he expects \"a flurry of deals\" to be announced before next week’s deadline. Inflation readings from March, April and May 2025 showed levels of inflation hovering slightly above the Fed’s 2% target, which Bostic said showed tariffs \"had not substantially affected consumer prices.\" Yet Bostic said he believed rosy data in recent months reflected \"firms’ strategies to delay substantive price increases\" until final tariff rates are set, rather than evidence that the economy had staved off tariff-related price pressures. TRUMP'S TARIFF POLICIES RESHAPE ONLINE SHOPPING HABITS, NEW REPORT FINDS The Atlanta Fed chief’s comments at a lecture in Frankfurt, Germany, came hours after Thursday’s June unemployment report showed that hiring for the month outpaced expectations, with the economy adding 147,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.1%. The Fed has held interest rates steady since December 2024, when the central bank cut its target range by a quarter of a percentage point amid what then seemed to markets like a rate-cutting cycle that was bound to continue. Jerome Powell speaking with his hands up Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that he believes the central bank would have continued to cut interest rates had tariffs not been implemented. (REUTERS/Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/File Photo / Reuters Photos) Powell said Tuesday that he believes the Fed would have continued to cut interest rates had tariffs not been implemented, adding that \"we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs.\" Bostic’s calls for patience on monetary policy moves echoed Richmond Federal Reserve President Tom Barkin’s assessment of the central bank's position Wednesday. In an interview with FOX Business’ \"The Claman Countdown,\" Barkin compared the Fed’s efforts to discern tariffs’ impact on the economy to \"driving through fog,\" a metaphor he has used since March to describe the difficulty facing the FOMC.

(Photographer: Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) \"You don't know what the impact of policy is going to be on the economy,\" Barkin said. \"And so long as there's no urgency from the bigger environment, I think one does what one does when you drive through fog, which is go slowly.\""
