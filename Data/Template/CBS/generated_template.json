        "source": "CBS",
        "content": "President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, or what he's calling \"Liberation Day,\" aimed at erasing trade deficits between the U.S. and its trading partners. \n\nThe two new tariffs are: \n\nA 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the U.S.\nSocalled reciprocal tariffs that will be applied to imports from 90 nations.\nMr. Trump, who announced the tariffs in the White House's Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, said his plans reflect \"one of the most important days in American history; it's our declaration of economic independence.\" Even so, economists say the tariffs will boost prices on many products purchased by American consumers, at a time when inflation still remains elevated. \n\nAn overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs\nThe first tariff will be a 10% acrosstheboard tax applied to all imports to the U.S. \n\nThe second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"\n\n\nHe added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"\n\nOne example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.\n\n\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added. \n\nWhat is a reciprocal tariff? \nAt the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.\n\nTruly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a productbyproduct basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover nonmonetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations. \n\nWhen do the tariffs go into effect? \nThe baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. \n\nWhy is Trump imposing these new tariffs?\nDuring his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"\n\nMr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household. \n\nFor instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index — an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve — could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.\n\nThat estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%."

        "headline": "Does the \"big beautiful bill\" eliminate taxes on Social Security?",
        "source": "CBS",
        "content": "MoneyWatch Does the \"big, beautiful bill\" eliminate taxes on Social Security? moneywatch By Edited By Updated on: July 4, 2025 / 8:17 PM EDT / CBS News As Congress was approving President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\" That claim, which echoes previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely. In a press release, SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\" That figure draws on a June analysis by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors — or 51.4 million people — on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits. The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\" Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries. \"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill. The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment. How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security? The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income — not just to Social Security benefits. Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure. What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028. \"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts. Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little. \"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June report that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\" The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education. \"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and people who benefit the most are the richest people,\" Kogan added. More pressure on Social Security? Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action. \"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7% by 2054. As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans. \"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released."

        "content": "Washington — President Trump brought pomp and circumstance to his signing of the \"big, beautiful bill\" on Friday, with an Independence Day ceremony at the White House that included a B-2 bomber flyover. Some Republican members of Congress who voted to pass the legislation attended the event in which the president put his signature on his sweeping domestic policy bill. They stood around Mr. Trump with their thumbs up as he signed the bill. The final bill hasn't appeased all Republicans, but the president and Congress managed to pass it ahead of their self-imposed July Fourth deadline. \"What we've done is put everything into one bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I liked it because we had so much in there that no matter who you are, there was something in that bill that would make your congressman or your senator or your congresswoman, much more importantly, raise their hand and support it.\" Trump Fourth of July President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump stand for the National Anthem at a picnic for military families at the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Washington. Julia Demaree Nikhinson / AP The president praised Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, for their work in holding the conference together to get the bill over the finish line. \"Those two are a team that is not going to be beat,\" Mr. Trump said. The president watched coverage of the bill's passage from the White House on Thursday. Mr. Trump took a victory lap during a speech in Iowa Thursday night, calling the first five months of his second term \"a declaration of independence from a, really, national decline.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the legislation \"an encapsulation of all of the policies that the president campaigned on and the American people voted on,\" and said it's a \"victorious day for the American people.\" President Donald Trump bangs a gavel presented to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson of La., after he signed his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Washington. President Donald Trump bangs a gavel presented to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson of La., after he signed his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Washington. Evan Vucci / AP Following days of handwringing and negotiations, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries breaking the record for the longest speech on the House floor, the House passed the legislation Thursday afternoon in a 218-214 vote. Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Thomas Massie voted against the legislation, and no Democrats voted for it. GOP leadership and the White House spoke with Republican holdouts for hours to advance the bill early Thursday morning. A senior Trump White House official told reporters on a press call Thursday that the president was \"deeply\" involved in the process of the bill, and through \"late-night phone calls,\" helped move the bill forward in Congress. Vice President JD Vance was also closely involved, the official said. Mr. Trump also spent part of Friday's event honoring the military members involved in the U.S. strikes against some of Iran's nuclear facilities last month. What's in the \"big, beautiful bill\"? The current $2,000 child tax credit, which would return to a pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026, will permanently increase to $2,200. The legislation includes tougher restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade. The bill would allow many tipped workers to deduct up to $25,000 of their tips and overtime from their taxes. That provision expires in 2028. The bill would make changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, expanding work requirements and requiring state governments with higher payment error rates to cover some of the program's costs. The legislation also includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000. The bill would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the initial House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer."

Earlier Friday, Abbott asked that Texas residents \"heed guidance from state and local officials and monitor local forecasts to avoid driving into flooded areas.\" APTOPIX Extreme Weather Texas A helicopter flies over the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Kerrville, Texas.

Ted Cruz said in a statement posted to social media that he had spoken to Mr. Trump, as well as other state officials. \"President Trump committed ANYTHING Texas needs,\" Cruz said. Lorena Gullen, who owns a restaurant right next to an RV park that was affected by the floods, said \"raging water\" swept away vehicles, some with people still inside. Residents at the park had been celebrating the Fourth of July. \"You could also see vehicles coming from up the river with the lights on and hear somebody honking, and they were washing away but they kept going,\" she told CBS Evening News. \"It was impossible.\" Over two dozen people still missing Three girls from Dallas — 8-year-old Hadley Hanna and 9-year-olds Eloise Peck and Lila Bonner — have been identified as among the Camp Mystic campers who were missing. The family of Bonner confirmed to CBS Texas on Saturday that she was among the children confirmed dead in the flood. Two sisters from Dallas — 13-year-old Blair Harber and 11-year-old Brooke Harber, were also confirmed dead Saturday by the St. Rita Catholic Community church in Dallas. The sisters were not attending Camp Mystic, but were in the area when the flooding occurred. The girls were staying with their grandparents along the Guadalupe River, who remain unaccounted for, according to the church. Their parents were in a separate cabin and were not harmed. Meanwhile, Rep. August Pfluger of Texas said Saturday that two of his three children were evacuated from Camp Mystic. \"The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors,\" Pfluger said in a post on X. On Friday, Patrick addressed parents of children at Camp Mystic. The lieutenant governor, who briefly acted as governor while Abbott was on vacation, said they are praying for all those missing \"to be found alive.\" \"If they are alive and safe, we will find them and bring them home to you,\" Patrick said Friday.

Patrick said Camp Mystic is an all-girls summer camp in the area that has several camps with thousands of children attending for the summer. The camp said they have no power, no water and no Wi-Fi , adding that \"the highway has washed away, so we are struggling to get more help.\" \"Please pray for everyone in the Hill Country, especially Camp Mystic,\" Cruz said in his social media statement. The summer camp sits on a strip known as \"flash flood alley,\" Austin Dickson, the CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, told the Associated Press. The foundation is a charitable endowment that collects donations to help nonprofits responding to the disaster. \"When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,\" Dickson said. \"It rushes down the hill.\" Severe Weather Texas A flood gauge marks the height of water flowing over a farm-to-market road near Kerrville, Texas, on Friday, July 4, 2025.

Eric Gay / AP Elinor Lester, 13, told the Associated Press that she and her cabinmates were evacuated by helicopter. Her cabin was on elevated ground, but younger campers bunked in cabins situated along the riverbank, she said. Those were the first to flood. Younger campers came up the hill for shelter. \"The camp was completely destroyed,\" she told the Associated Press. \"It was really scary. Everyone I know personally is accounted for, but there are people missing that I know of and we don't know where they are.\" Her mother, Elizabeth Lester, told the Associated Press her son was at Camp La Junta, a nearby summer camp, and also survived after a counselor woke up, saw rising water and helped the boys swim out through a window. Camp La Junta and another camp on the river, Camp Waldemar, said in Instagram posts that all campers and staff there were safe. \"My kids are safe, but knowing others are still missing is just eating me alive,\" Elizabeth Lester told the Associated Press."
