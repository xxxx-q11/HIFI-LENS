>  Stock markets are complex adaptive systems whose dynamics emerge from decentralized interactions among diverse participants responding to an ever-shifting informational landscape. Despite decades of progress, existing simulation frameworks remain constrained by either low behavioral fidelity, due to non-intelligent agents, or low structural fidelity, due to oversimplified trading mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we introduce HIFI-LENS, a large-scale simulation framework that integrates structural realism with generative agent intelligence. HIFI-LENS captures market complexity across three interconnected levels: (i) at the micro-level, it simulates over 15k heterogeneous agents, featuring a novel hierarchical architecture for LLM-powered institutional investors; (ii) at the meso-level, these agents interact in a nanosecond-resolution, NASDAQ-like continuous double auction market; and (iii) at the macro-level, their behavior is grounded in a rich information stream of both endogenous market data and over 12k real-world news articles and reports. We validate HIFI-LENS across eight GICS sectors and three representative real-world scenarios, showing that it not only reproduces five key stylized facts, but also accurately tracks real-world high-frequency price dynamics with an average MAPE of 3.48\%. Our work paves the way for a new generation of market simulation, enabling high-fidelity studies of emergent phenomena, policy impacts, and AI-in-the-market dynamics.
